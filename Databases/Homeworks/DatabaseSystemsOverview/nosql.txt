A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

Examples of NoSQL database

Column
A column of a distributed data store is a NoSQL object of the lowest level in a keyspace. It is a tuple (a key-value pair) consisting of three elements:
Unique name: Used to reference the column
Value: The content of the column. It can have different types, like AsciiType, LongType, TimeUUIDType, UTF8Type among others.
Timestamp: The system timestamp used to determine the valid content.

Document
A document-oriented database is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data. 

Key-value
A key-value store, or key-value database, is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, 
a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash. 
Dictionaries contain a collection of objects, or records, which in turn have many different fields within them, each containing data. 
These records are stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to quickly find the data within the database.

Graph
A graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data.

Multi-model
Most database management systems are organized around a single data model that determines how data can be organized, stored, and manipulated. 
In contrast, a multi-model database is designed to support multiple data models against a single, integrated backend.
