A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.

Data is stored in those tables, which have name. Each column in the table has an unique name. Each table should have a primary key, 
which is unique for each row of information the table stores. We can use that primary key for access to the exact element, update it or delete it.
Primary keys are also used for relations between two tables.

A table is usually a multiset (bag) of rows where a relation is a set and does not allow duplicates.
Besides the actual data rows, tables generally have associated with them some metadata, such as constraints on the table or on the values within particular columns.
