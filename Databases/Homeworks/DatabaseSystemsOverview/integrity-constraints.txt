Data integrity refers to maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life-cycle, and is a critical aspect to the design, 
implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes, or retrieves data.

Primary Key Constraint
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table.

Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values.

A primary key column cannot contain NULL values.

Most tables should have a primary key, and each table can have only ONE primary key.

Unique Key Constraint
The UNIQUE constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table.

The UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints both provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint defined on it.

Note that you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.

Foreign Key Constraint
A FOREIGN KEY in one table points to a PRIMARY KEY in another table.

Check Constraint
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a single column it allows only certain values for this column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.
