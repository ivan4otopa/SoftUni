SQL means Structured Query Language. It is the standard language used for handling relational databases.
Databases are, basically, programs that can store and retrieve efficiently large amounts of information and the relational ones store this data as relations. 
Relations can be thought as tables, where each column is an attribute and each row is an entry.

Example
SELECT     EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, City
FROM       Employees
WHERE      (HireDate >= '1-june-1992') AND (HireDate <= '15-december-1993')
