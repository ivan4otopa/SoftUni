A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, 
of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Many popular databases currently in use are based on the relational database model.

A relational DBMS is special system software that is used to manage the organization, storage, access, security and integrity of data. 
This specialized software allows application systems to focus on the user interface, data validation and screen navigation. 
When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, the application system simply makes a "call" to the RDBMS.
