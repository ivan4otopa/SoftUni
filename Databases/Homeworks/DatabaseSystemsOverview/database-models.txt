A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored,
organized, and manipulated.

Common logical data models for databases include:

Hierarchical database model - A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. 
The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. 
A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value.
The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.
The hierarchical database model mandates that each child record has only one parent, whereas each parent record can have one or more child records. 
In order to retrieve data from a hierarchical database the whole tree needs to be traversed starting from the root node.

Network model - It is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. 
Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs.

Relational model - The relational model for database management is a database model based on first-order predicate logic, In the relational model of a database, 
all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations.

Object-oriented Model - Object-oriented models define a database as a collection of objects with features and methods.
